            <h2>Projects:</h2>
            <h3>Language Suggester</h3>
            <p>On this project I created an application for people interested in coding to decide which language they should learn first. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/davidabutler92/language-suggester.git">link</a>
            <h3>Celebrity App</h3>
            <p>For this project I created a celebrity dating webpage, where you enter information about yourself, and the page suggests which celebrity, fictional character, or public figure you would be most compatible with. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/davidabutler92/celebrity-app.git">link</a>
            <h3>Language Suggester</h3>
            <p>On this project I wrote a program where two users can play pig dice against eachother. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/davidabutler92/pig-dice.git">link</a>

            <h2>About me:</h2>
            <p>Primarily working with Javascript and React, Ruby and Rails but am always curious about learning new technologies and looking for ways to grow in tech. I'm looking forward too and very excited about working collaboratively on a motivated team and solve real world problems. When not coding, you will find me playing an online-multiplayer game, or an MMORPG but what I enjoy the most is, snowboarding blue bird days at our crowning jewel of Oregon, Mt. Hood.</p>
