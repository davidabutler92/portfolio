            <h3>Language Suggester</h3>
            <p>On this project I created an application for people interested in coding to decide which language they should learn first. <a href="https://github.com/davidabutler92/language-suggester.git">link</a>
            <h3>Celebrity App</h3>
            <p>For this project I created a celebrity dating webpage, where you enter information about yourself, and the page suggests which celebrity, fictional character, or public figure you would be most compatible with. <a href="https://github.com/davidabutler92/celebrity-app.git">link</a>
            <h3>Language Suggester</h3>
            <p>On this project I wrote a program where two users can play pig dice against eachother. <a href="https://github.com/davidabutler92/pig-dice.git">link</a>

            <h2>About me:</h2>
            <p>Primarily working with <span style="color:yellow">Javascript</span> and <span style="color:blue">React</span>, Ruby and Rails but am always curious about learning new technologies and looking for ways to grow in tech. I'm looking forward too and very excited about working collaboratively on a motivated team and solve real world problems. When not coding, you will find me playing an online-multiplayer game, or an MMORPG but what I enjoy the most is, snowboarding blue bird days at our crowning jewel of Oregon, Mt. Hood.</p>

            <h2>Background:</h2>
            <p>Before joining Epicodus I was in construction and I had doubts at how much information I could retain or that I wouldn't be able keep up. This school however, blew my expectations out of the water and I'm currently learning how to build web apps using Javascript, Ruby and Rails, React/Redux HTML and CSS. I have a growing passion for software developing and looking forward to working in the field full-time.</p>
